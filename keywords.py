When an infectious organism such as a virus or bacteria enters the body, the white blood cells are the first line of defense for destroying the invading organism. Infection with certain organisms, however, can have serious effects on the immune system.\n\nAIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a disorder that is caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This virus attaches to the surface of specific white blood cells called T cells and is therefore able to reproduce and continue production of the virus. As more and more of the body's healthy T cells become infected with HIV, the body's immune system becomes compromised.\n\nAs a result, if another foreign organism enters the body, the white blood cells are unable to fight the new infection and serious illness can result. In addition, there are many illnesses that persons infected with HIV are more susceptible for developing than are persons with healthy immune systems.\n\nA diagnosis of AIDS is made after T cell counts reach a dangerously low level and blood tests confirm the presence of antibodies to HIV, indicating that the virus is present in the body. Symptoms of AIDS may not appear for 5 to 10 years after being infected with HIV.",

During pregnancy, mammary glands swell in order to accommodate milk production. This process is regulated by hormones.\n\nBreast cancer is a malignant neoplasm of the mammary gland. It is one of the most common causes of cancer fatality in women. Early detection through regular breast self-examination and mammography is key. Through self-examination irregularities, such as lumps or masses, can be detected before the disease has had a chance to spread. The danger associated with all cancer, but especially with breast cancer, is that the disease can travel quickly once it has invaded the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system provides the perfect harbor for cancers to travel throughout the body.",

Although the right lung has three lobes, the left lung has only two lobes due to the position of the heart, which is toward the left side of the body.\n\nDuring respiration, air travels through the nose, down the trachea or windpipe, and into the bronchus. The bronchus branches into narrower bronchioles and then into smaller and smaller airways ending in air sacs called alveoli. It is at the alveoli that oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide.\n\nMost cancerous changes occur in the lungs long before any symptoms are present. There are many types of lung cancer, but the most common lung cancer is bronchogenic carcinoma, which begins as a tumor in the lining of the bronchi. Lung cancer can also be present in the trachea, the bronchioles, or the alveoli.\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among men and women, but the most alarming news is that more women will die from lung cancer than will die from breast cancer. Cigarette smoking poses the greatest risk for developing lung cancer.",

Its primary function is to release fluid into the urethra during ejaculation.\n\nDuring ejaculation, sperm travels from the testicle through tubes called the vas deferens. The vas deferens run behind the bladder and enter into the prostate gland. During its journey, sperm combines with seminal fluids, other components of ejaculate, from three sources - the seminal vesicles, the prostate, and the bulbourethral glands. The combined fluids, called semen or ejaculate, then travel the length of the urethra and out of the body via the penis.\n\nProstate cancer develops as small nodules or bumps on the surface of the prostate, which can be detected during rectal examination. There are many methods to treat prostate cancer. In most cases, the prostate does not need to be removed if the cancer is detected early. If prostate removal is necessary, the risk for erectile dysfunction increases because of the large number of nerves located near the prostate.\n\nMen over the age of 50 should have routine prostate cancer screening as part of their regular health check up; this includes digital rectal examination and serum PSA testing. Talk to your doctor about your individual risk for prostate cancer.",

White blood cells, or leukocytes, are produced in the bones. Their primary function is to identify and destroy harmful antigens that enter the body. This is called the immune response--the way the body recognizes and defends itself against bacteria, viruses, and substances recognized as foreign and potentially harmful to the body.\n\nOnce the white blood cells encounter an antigen, or foreign substance, they are stimulated to divide and produce specialized cells to kill the substance.\n\nIf the body becomes infected with bacteria, the white blood cells go through a trial-and-error period to determine the best way to kill the bacteria.  When the white blood cells determine how to destroy the bacteria, they create "memory cells" to handle future attacks of that same bacteria.\n\nVaccination is a way to trigger the immune response. When a person receives a vaccination, a very small amount of a disease-causing agent, called a vaccine, is injected into the body for the immune system to identify and then destroy. The amount of the bacteria in the vaccine is very small and is often weakened or dead. It usually does not cause illness. The body is then able to destroy the bacteria in the vaccine. Receiving a vaccination activates the immune system\'s "memory," allowing the body to react quickly by releasing antibodies to future exposures and thereby destroying the bacteria before it can cause illness. When the body develops immunity to a specific antigen, immunization has occurred.',

The light then passes through the lens where the image is focused onto the retina at the back of the eye. The image is then converted to electrical signals that are sent to the brain.\n\nIt is essential that the lens remains transparent in order for clear vision. When cataracts occur, the lens becomes cloudy or opaque, preventing light from passing clearly to the retina. Cataracts often occur as a person ages but can develop as a result of other medical conditions. A doctor will need to perform an eye examination in order to confirm the diagnosis of cataracts and to recommend treatment.",

Sometimes, a problem with the conduction system causes the heart to beat too fast, too slow, or to have an erratic or irregular beat.  A test, called an electrocardiogram, or EKG, can measure and record the heart's electrical activity. \n\nIn a normal heartbeat, the heart's signal follows a specific pathway through the heart. The signal begins in the sino-atrial node, or SA node, located in the right atrium. The SA node triggers the atria to contract, pushing blood into the ventricles. The electrical signal then travels through the atrio-ventricular node, or AV node, and into the ventricles. This signal now causes the ventricles to contract, pumping blood to the lungs and body\n\nAtrial fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia, or abnormal heartbeat, that is caused by erratic electrical signals originating from the atria. During this rhythm disturbance, the normal, coordinated contractions between the atria and ventricles become compromised, interfering with the hearts ability to efficiently deliver blood to the body.\n\nIn people who experience atrial fibrillation, many rapid electrical impulses originating from different areas of the heart are sent to the atria.  These impulses cause a very fast and chaotic rhythm. Because of this rhythm, the contractions of the atria become erratic. As a result, the irregular contractions of the atria do not properly fill the ventricles with blood, causing the ventricular contractions to also become erratic. The heart rate may increase to 100 to 175 beats per minute or more.\n\nAtrial fibrillation can cause fainting, weakness, and may lead to blood clots and other complications. The condition can be treated with medication or with surgery. In some patients, a pacemaker may be inserted in order to regulate heart rhythm.",

        "script": "The heart is the primary organ of the cardiovascular system.  It is a beating muscle that continually pumps blood to the rest of the body. The coronary arteries supply the heart itself with the necessary oxygen and nutrients it needs to function effectively.\n\nRed blood cells, white blood cells and other substances flow freely to the heart and other parts of the body. In a healthy person, the walls of the artery are smooth and uniform in thickness. Over time, however, a high level of circulating cholesterol can cause fatty deposits, called plaque, to accumulate.\n\nAs plaque is deposited, it can harden and cause the artery to become narrowed and less flexible, a condition called atherosclerosis. If atherosclerosis develops in the coronary arteries, the condition is called coronary artery disease, or CAD. If blood flow is severely interrupted, a myocardial infarction can occur.  A myocardial infarction, or MI, is another term for heart attack.\n\nIf blockage of a coronary artery exceeds 70 percent, the risk is increased for experiencing a heart attack; the risk is almost certain when plaque completely blocks a coronary artery. \n\nAnother way CAD can increase the risk for an MI is by the development of a blood clot. Oftentimes a crack can develop at the site of plaque buildup. When this happens, blood can coagulate, or clump together, at the site of the crack, or a blood clot, called a thrombus, can grow in size until it completely blocks blood flow.\n\nThe extent of damage sustained by the heart during an MI depends on the severity and location of the blockage, and the speed at which medical treatment is received. Fortunately, there are many ways to prevent atherosclerosis, and to lower the risk for developing a heart attack.",

Glucose circulates in the bloodstream and is used as food for the body's cells. But the cells cannot absorb glucose alone. A hormone called insulin, which is produced in the pancreas, must first bind to the cell surface. When this occurs, cells of the body are activated and are able to absorb the glucose. This process returns the body's blood sugar to a normal level.\n\nDiabetes mellitus is a disorder that affects the body's ability to efficiently utilize blood glucose. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, so glucose cannot be absorbed to refuel the cells. In type 2 diabetes, insulin is produced, but it does not work properly and the glucose is not absorbed consistently by the cells. Both types of diabetes have the same results: glucose is not absorbed by the cells.  That is why people with diabetes have high blood sugar levels. Without proper absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, the cells are starving for food.\n\nRegardless of which type of diabetes a person may have, people with diabetes must monitor their blood sugar levels. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, diabetes can be managed with diet or with medication.",

The back, or posterior larger chamber, is filled with a thick, jelly-like fluid, which is referred to as the vitreous humor. \n\nThe clear and watery eye fluid in the anterior chamber is called the aqueous humor, which is continually being formed and absorbed as it flows through the eye. This fluid is formed near the lens, flows to the front chamber of the eye, and then drains into the venous system through a tiny drainage duct.\n\nGlaucoma, which is a common cause of blindness, is a disease that affects the drainage of the aqueous humor causing pressure to build within the eye. There are many types and causes of glaucoma. Often, glaucoma occurs when either a sponge-like meshwork that filters eye fluid becomes compacted and prevents fluid from entering the duct, or when the iris of the eye covers the canal opening. \n\nIn either case, the accumulation of fluid within the eye creates pressure that pushes on the back of the eye and damages the optic nerve. This nerve is responsible for transmitting the images to the brain. Over time, the increased pressure can result in blind spots and even total blindness.

They are located towards the back of the torso, behind the lower ribs.\nThe primary function of the kidneys is to filter blood for the removal of waste products. Wastes are expelled from the kidneys as urine, which travel out of the kidneys via tubes called ureters that connect to the bladder.\nOccasionally, calculi or crystals form in a kidney and are referred to as kidney stones. These are a combination of calcium, uric acid and other substances found in urine. Many people pass small kidney stones from their bodies without any symptoms, but larger stones can be very painful as they move through the ureter, into the bladder, and out of the body. \nChanges in diet may help to reduce the risk for kidney stones. Management by a doctor to treat and prevent kidney stones is recommended for patients at risk.",

Inflammation then leads to constriction of the muscles around the airways, causing the airways to become narrow. This narrowing is also referred to as bronchospasm. The third change is increased sensitivity of the airways, causing the asthma patient to become overly sensitive to animal dander, pollen, cold air and tobacco smoke, to name a few.\n\nAsthma patients need to work together with their doctors to develop a medication action plan to control symptoms and minimize attacks.",

However, if the egg is not fertilized, the endometrial layer is sloughed off as a normal part of the menstrual cycle.\n\nEndometriosis is a condition in which endometrial cells become attached to tissues surrounding the uterus, such as the fallopian tubes, the ovaries, or the large or small intestines.\n\nDuring the portion of the menstrual cycle in which the endometrial layer grows, the cells located outside of the uterus also grow. When ovulation occurs and the egg is not fertilized, the endometrial cells slough off both inside and outside of the uterus, causing bleeding, intense cramping, and pain.

If the coronary arteries develop plaque, blood flow to the heart can be compromised.\n\nBalloon angioplasty is a procedure which opens arteries that have become narrowed or clogged from plaque buildup. During this procedure, a small incision is made in the groin to gain access to the femoral artery. A guide wire is then inserted into the femoral artery and is threaded through the artery to the site of the blockage.\n\nA catheter that is attached to a deflated balloon moves along the guide wire to the site of the blockage. When the balloon is inflated, it compresses the plaque against the arterial wall enlarging the opening of the artery. This enables blood to move normally through the artery.\n\nOftentimes during angioplasty, a stent is inserted at the site of the blockage to help the artery from reclosing. A stent is a wire mesh tube placed around the deflated balloon catheter. When the catheter is guided to the blockage site and is inflated, the stent expands and adheres to the artery wall. The catheter and guide wire are then removed and the stent remains in place.\n\nBoth angioplasty and angioplasty with stenting may need to be repeated if the plaque buildup returns.",

During pregnancy, mammary glands swell in order to accommodate milk production. Mammary glands are also the place where most breast cancers begin.\n\nFollowing a mastectomy, or the surgical removal of breast tissue, many women choose to have breast reconstructive surgery for both emotional and physical reasons.\n\nSometimes, the skin where the breast has been removed needs to be stretched before the reconstructive surgery can occur. This is accomplished by inserting a type of implant, called an expander, beneath the skin and chest muscle. An expander is similar to a balloon, and it is slowly filled with a saline solution at periodic intervals.\n\nWhen the skin has been stretched adequately, a second surgery will be performed to remove the expander and to replace it with a permanent implant. However, under certain conditions, the expander can be left in place permanently.\n\nAnother common breast reconstruction method involves using healthy skin and muscle from other areas of the body. One method is to use a section of skin that is attached to the latissimus muscle in the back. Another method uses part of the abdominal rectus muscle, which can be slid up into the breast area as part of breast reconstruction. Many women also choose to have nipple reconstruction and breast implants with whichever form of breast reconstruction they choose.\n\nReconstructive breast surgery can be performed at the time of mastectomy although it's common for women to make the decision for reconstruction at some point following mastectomy.\n\nThere are several potential complications associated with this procedure that should be discussed with a doctor prior to surgery.",

Regular breast self-examination is an important step to early detection.\n\nThe female breast is primarily composed of fatty tissue and mammary glands. Mammary glands drain into the lactiferous sinus, which connects them to the nipple. During pregnancy, mammary glands swell in order to accommodate milk production. The mammary gland is also the place where most breast cancers begin.\n\nBreast self-examination, or BSE, should be done at the same time each month, right after your menstrual cycle has ended. The first step in BSE is visual inspection: stand in front of a mirror with your hands on your hips. Look at your breasts, paying special attention to any skin changes (redness, swelling, puckering) as well as to any nipple changes (indentation, scaling, discharge). Now raise your hands over your head and check again for any change in appearance or contour.\n\nThere are three common methods for the next two steps in BSE. They are all effective, but you can try each of them to see which one works best for you. Regardless of the method you choose, the objective of this step is to feel, or palpate, the entire breast area in both the upright and reclining position, and to notice any changes that occur in the breast from month to month. On palpation, the breast should be soft and smooth when you push on it, like an extra-firm bed pillow.\n\nThe line method for palpating the breast involves using the soft pad of your three middle fingers to move in a vertical line, starting in the underarm area and moving down below the breast. Move over a little and slowly move back up. Repeat this up and down motion until the entire breast and underarm area has been examined.\n\nThe circle method involves moving your three middle fingers in a circular motion, starting at the outer edge of the breast and working your way in slowly, toward the nipple. Be sure to check the underarm area and the upper chest area as well.\n\nThe last method involves feeling or palpating the breast in wedges. Use your three middle fingers, and beginning at the outer edge of the breast, move in toward the nipple. Go back to the outer edge and check the next wedge of the breast. Repeat this procedure until the entire breast is palpated. Once again, check the underarm and upper chest areas.\n\nIf you notice any changes or discover a lump or knot that feels like a small, hard pebble, you should contact your doctor as soon as possible. Keep in mind that BSE should be used in conjunction with clinical breast examinations by a doctor, and also with mammography, according to your doctor's recommendation.",

The focusing power of the eye depends on the elasticity of the lens. As a person ages, the elasticity in the lenses decrease, causing presbyopia.  A presbyopic person sees faraway objects clearly. However, the images of nearby objects focus behind the retina, causing these objects to look blurred.\n\nSymptoms of presbyopia may include tired eyes, headaches, and blurred near-vision. People often notice the first symptom of presbyopia when they need to hold reading material farther away from themselves in order to focus more clearly. Presbyopia normally occurs in people over the age of 40. A doctor may prescribe reading glasses to correct this vision deficiency.",

Urinary incontinence is most common in women. Approximately 10 percent of all women have regular incontinence, and nearly 20 percent of women over age 75 experience daily urinary incontinence.  At least 50 percent of women have experienced incontinence at some time in their lives.\n\nThere are many causes of urinary incontinence. Stress incontinence is the most common. It occurs when the strength of the urethral sphincter is diminished, and the sphincter is not able to prevent urine flow when there is increased pressure from the abdomen. Some of the risk factors for this type of incontinence include age, damage to the urethra and childbirth.\n\nUrge incontinence occurs when the bladder muscle contracts inappropriately. Often the contractions occur regardless of the amount of urine that is in the bladder. Urge incontinence may result from spinal cord injury, neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, infection, or bladder cancer; in men, benign prostatic hypertrophy may also be a risk factor. A doctor can prescribe an appropriate treatment according to the severity and cause of the incontinence.",

It begins to degenerate and may cause discogenic low back pain. Discogenic pain is a term back specialists use when referring to pain caused by a damaged intervertebral disc. A degenerating disc may cause pain as the disc begins to degenerate and there is some evidence that the disc itself becomes painful. Movements that place stress on the disc may result in low back pain that may extend into the buttocks area and even as far as the upper thigh. Many doctors choose to approach the diseased discs from the back. A portion of the vertebrae is removed to allow the doctor to access the intervertebral disc. Part of the damaged disc is then removed and an interbody device is inserted between the vertebrae. Pedicle screws are inserted into the vertebrae and then attached to internal fixation rods to provide stabilization so that proper fusion can occur after the surgery. Bone graft material is placed at the site to stimulate bone growth. The most conservative method for bone grafting is to use synthetic or demineralized bone matrix. Specialized cells called osteoblasts within the existing bone help fuse the vertebrae and create new bone material. There are risks and complications to this procedure that should be discussed in detail with the physician prior to surgery",

In one form of OPCAB, the chest is opened, and the surgeon uses a stabilization device to restrict the heart's motion.\n\nA small elastic tape is placed around the blocked artery to stop the flow of blood. A vessel, taken from another part of the body, is attached from the aorta to a point beyond the blockage. The clamps are loosened and blood flow resumes through the repaired artery.\n\nSome patients may be candidates for a less invasive version of the OPCAB. Called MIDCAB, for minimally invasive coronary artery bypass, a small hole is made in the patient's left side. The heart is stabilized and the patient's mammary artery is used to detour blood around the blocked coronary artery.",

Inside the heart, four valves open and shut in a precise sequence that keeps the blood moving in the appropriate direction. A malformed or damaged valve may not close properly, allowing blood to leak backwards. This condition is called valvular regurgitation, or valvular insufficiency.\n\nIn a healthy heart, two valves control the flow of blood from the upper chambers, or atria, to the lower chambers, or ventricles. Two other valves control blood flow from the ventricles to the lungs and body.\n\nOxygen-rich blood moves from the left atrium to the left ventricle through the mitral valve. The ventricle pumps the blood through the aortic valve to be distributed throughout the body. Oxygen-poor blood moves from the right atrium to the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve, and is pumped through the pulmonic valve on its way to the lungs to pick up oxygen.\n\nThe two atrioventricular valves, the mitral valve, and the tricuspid valve, are connected to the papillary muscle of the ventricles, by thin, fibrous strands of tissue called chordae tendineae. The papillary muscle via the chordae tendineae holds the flaps, or cusps, of each valve in place. When the ventricles contract, the blood pressure pushes the cusps of the mitral and tricuspid valves shut. \n\nIf there is not enough tension on the chordae tendineae, the cusps may not close properly and blood may leak backwards, or regurgitate. In this example, the cusps of the mitral valve are prolapsing, or failing to close properly. Blood is leaking back into the left atrium from the ventricle. \n\nThe valves of the lower two chambers, the pulmonic and aortic valves, open and close due to the changes in pressure from the contractions of the atria and ventricles. These valves are also susceptible to disease or damage, causing regurgitation as a result of a leaky valve.\n\nBecause blood is leaking in side the heart, less oxygen-rich blood is circulating throughout the body, causing the heart to work harder. If not treated, valvular regurgitation can lead to heart damage or further valve damage.",

        "script": "Food and liquid pass from the mouth to the stomach through a muscular tube called the esophagus. Sometimes, the cells of the esophagus become cancerous. When the cells of the esophagus divide without order or control, it is called esophageal cancer. \n\nThere are two types of esophageal cancer: squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma. The lining of the esophagus is made up of flat, thin cells called squamous cells. Squamous cell cancer develops in the upper and middle part of the esophagus. In addition to the squamous cells, the esophagus contains glandular cells. The glandular cells make and release mucus and other fluids that help with digestion. If stomach acids back up into the lower part of the esophagus, the acids may irritate the glandular cells causing the cells to change. These changes can lead to cancer in glandular cells, called adenocarcinoma. \n\nSymptoms of esophageal cancer include difficulty swallowing, severe weight loss, pain in the throat, back, or behind the breastbone, vomiting, or hoarseness. Esophageal cancer can spread (metastasize) to other organs in the body. Surgery is the most common treatment for either type of esophageal cancer. Radiation and chemotherapy may also be used. New types of treatments, such as laser therapy and photodynamic therapy may be used to ease symptoms. New immunotherapy agents can also target the tumor cells.\n\nThe immune system is an important line of defense against tumors. Cancerous tumors are made up of many abnormal cells that multiply faster than normal. This causes them to grow into masses that can be malignant. Because they are abnormal, the molecules they produce, called antigens, do not match the molecules that normal cells make. When immune cells capture these antigens, they recognize that they are different and possibly a threat, which causes them to seek out other immune cells in the body. It will find a specific white blood cell and show it the captured antigen. The white blood cell has special receptors on its surface that allow it to remember this potential threat. It is activated and ready to attack any cells that have that specific antigen on its surface. Many activated white blood cells are recruited and travel to the tumor to defend the body.\n\nWhen the white blood cell arrives at a tumor cell, it binds to the surface to check whether or not it is a threat. If it recognizes the antigen, that is a signal for the white blood cell to attack the abnormal cell and kill it. More recruited white blood cells help to destroy the tumor, one cell at a time. \n\nThe white blood cells have an off-switch receptor to prevent them from attacking normal, healthy cells in the body. Because the immune system is so efficient, it is important that it does not begin turning against the body’s own cells by mistake. Normal cells that might otherwise be targeted by white blood cells can bind to the receptor with ligands that send a stop signal and act as a safety checkpoint to turn off the white blood cell before it attacks. When the receptor binds to its ligands on these cells, it will read it as familiar, even if there are unfamiliar antigens on the surface.\n\nHowever, some tumor cells can use this safety checkpoint to their advantage. They display a lot of the two matching ligands. The amount of these ligands creates a stop signal so strong that when the receptor binds to them, the white blood cell mistakes the tumor cell as healthy and normal, even if it sees the abnormal antigen. This acts like an off-switch and the white blood cell will stop attacking. \n\nIn a tumor, many of the abnormal cells may be able to avoid detection this way. This results in the immune system no longer recognizing the threat, so the tumor will continue to grow.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies are a type of therapy and are made to stick to a specific molecule. In this case, the monoclonal antibody is designed to bind to the misleading markers on the surface of the tumor cell. When the white blood cell binds, it no longer recognizes those off-switch markers—it only recognizes the abnormal antigen. This blocks the tumor cell’s attempt to hide and allows the white blood cell to remain activated. Now that the white blood cell recognizes that the tumor cell is a threat to the body, it will attack and destroy it. \n\nAs more tumor cells are destroyed, this can stop the spread of cancer by reducing metastatic growth in your body. Your doctor will be able to scan your body to see the improvement.",

Next, the cell enters the S phase, where the DNA inside the nucleus is replicated. Following replication, the cell prepares for upcoming division with a secondary period of growth, called the G2 phase. These three phases are collectively referred to as interphase and indicate the period in the cell cycle when the cell is not actively dividing. When the cell is ready for division it enters the mitotic phase of the cell cycle, where the cell undergoes mitosis.\n\nMitosis is divided into five stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.\n\nDuring prophase, the duplicated DNA coils and condenses into chromosomes, with kinetochores appearing at the centromeres. The nuclear envelope breaks down, allowing the chromosomes to move more freely about the cell. Organelles called centrosomes (composed of a pair of centrioles) migrate toward opposite poles of the cell. Microtubule fibers called mitotic spindles emerge from these centrosomes and extend across the cell. \n\nTowards the end of prophase is a transitionary stage called prometaphase, where mitotic spindles attach to the kinetochores of the chromosomes.\n\nIn metaphase, the mitotic spindles push and pull the duplicated chromosomes until they are lined up at the center of the cell along the metaphase or equatorial plate.\n\nOnce the chromosomes are all correctly aligned, anaphase begins. The microtubules shorten, pulling sister chromatids apart by their kinetochores towards opposite poles of the cell. At the same time, spindle fibers that have not attached to a kinetochore continue to grow, pushing the two poles apart.  The cell begins to elongate.\n\nDuring telophase, nuclear envelopes form around each set of separated chromosomes. The chromosomes uncoil and return to a decondensed state, the mitotic spindles break down, and spindle fibers continue to push the poles apart. The formation of two daughter nuclei marks the end of mitosis.\n\nFollowing mitosis, the cytoplasm fully divides the two identical daughter cells via cytokinesis.  Each daughter cell now continues to grow in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.",
